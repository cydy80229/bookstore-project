# Online Bookstore
We design a web-based application for university students to purchase books at an online bookstore. All students can create an account with their email and name. Also, the bookstore manager has an admin account which can check orders and account. Only admin account can add and modify book (books information, books stock and priceâ€¦). Also, the students can easily find the book they want.
